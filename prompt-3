## Introduction
DrugNcoin is a mem-coin developed on the TON blockchain. The project aims to create a cryptocurrency with a total supply of 1 billion tokens, of which 100 million tokens are reserved for the team. A website will facilitate the pre-sale of these tokens across three rounds with varying prices.

## Tokenomics
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion tokens
- **Reserved for Team**: 100 million tokens (owned by the project team)
- **Pre-Sale Rounds**:
  - **First Round**: 15 cents per token, ends on 10 August 2024
  - **Second Round**: 20 cents per token, ends on 30 August 2024
  - **Third Round**: 30 cents per token, ends on 30 September 2024

## Website Requirements

### Features
1. **Homepage**: Overview of DrugNcoin and its unique selling points.
2. **Tokenomics Page**: Detailed explanation of the tokenomics.
3. **Roadmap**: Timeline of the project development and milestones.
4. **Pre-Sale Functionality**: 
    - Connect to TON wallet
    - Display current pre-sale round and price
    - Accept payments via PayPal and Adyen
    - Calculate and transfer tokens to the user's TON wallet upon successful payment
5. **Wallet Integration**: Users must connect their TON wallet to participate in the pre-sale.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js (preferable due to better integration with TON wallet/blockchain)
- **Payment Systems**: PayPal API and Adyen
- **Blockchain**: TON blockchain for token transactions

## TON Blockchain Integration

### Smart Contracts
Develop smart contracts for the DrugNcoin token on the TON blockchain. The contracts should handle:
- Token creation and distribution
- Pre-sale round management
- Token transfer upon successful payment

## Payment Integration
- **PayPal API**: For handling payments via PayPal.
- **Adyen**: For handling card payments and native bank payments.
- **Payment Flow**:
  1. User connects their TON wallet.
  2. User selects the number of tokens to purchase.
  3. Payment is processed via PayPal or Adyen.
  4. Upon successful payment, tokens are transferred to the user's TON wallet based on the current pre-sale price.

## Server-Side Requirements
- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilize AWS Lambda for any server-side logic if necessary.
- **Serverless Framework**: For deployment and management of AWS Lambda functions.
- **Functions**:
  - Payment verification and processing
  - Token transfer upon successful payment

## Deployment
- **Hosting**: Host the website on a reliable platform (e.g., AWS S3 for static hosting).
- **Serverless Deployment**: Deploy server-side functions using the Serverless Framework on AWS Lambda.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Roadmap
1. **Q3 2024**: 
    - Develop and deploy the smart contracts on the TON blockchain.
    - Develop the website and integrate with TON wallet.
    - Implement payment systems (PayPal and Adyen).
    - Launch the first round of pre-sale.
2. **Q4 2024**:
    - Monitor and support the pre-sale rounds.
    - Continue development based on community feedback and market conditions.
    - Plan post-pre-sale development and potential exchange listings.
