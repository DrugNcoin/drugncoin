## Tokenomics

### Specifications
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion tokens
- **Reserved for Team**: 100 million tokens (held by the project owner)

### Distribution
- **Public**: 900 million tokens
- **Team**: 100 million tokens

## Website

The website will have a simple and intuitive design similar to standard mem-coin advertisement websites. It will include the following pages:

### Home Page
- **Introduction**: Brief description of DrugNcoin.
- **Features**: Key features of the token.
- **Call to Action**: Links to pre-sale and tokenomics pages.

### Tokenomics Page
- **Total Supply**: Display the total supply of tokens.
- **Distribution**: Detailed breakdown of token distribution.
- **Reserve**: Information about the reserved tokens for the team.

### Roadmap Page
- **Project Phases**: Timeline of the project development stages.
- **Milestones**: Key milestones and goals.

### Pre-Sale Page
- **Round Information**: Details of the three pre-sale rounds.
  - **First Round**: 15 cents per token
  - **Second Round**: 20 cents per token
  - **Third Round**: 30 cents per token
- **Payment Options**: PayPal and Adyen integrations.
- **Purchase Form**: Form for users to buy tokens.

### Contact Page
- **Contact Form**: Form for users to contact the team.
- **Social Media Links**: Links to social media profiles.

## Payment Integration

Integrate PayPal API and Adyen for handling payments. This will allow users to purchase tokens using various payment methods including credit/debit cards and native bank payments.

### PayPal API
- **Integration**: Use PayPal REST API for transactions.
- **Features**: Handle payments, refunds, and transaction history.

### Adyen
- **Integration**: Use Adyen's API for card payments and bank transfers.
- **Features**: Secure payment processing, multi-currency support.

## Smart Contracts

### Token Contract

Develop a smart contract on the TON blockchain for the DrugNcoin token.

#### Features
- **Minting**: Mint a total of 1 billion tokens.
- **Transfer**: Enable token transfers between addresses.
- **Reserve**: Allocate 100 million tokens to the project ownerâ€™s address.

### Pre-Sale Contract

Develop a pre-sale smart contract to handle the three rounds of token sales.

#### Features
- **Round Management**: Manage the three pre-sale rounds with specified prices.
- **Token Allocation**: Allocate tokens to purchasers based on the round prices.
- **Funds Collection**: Collect funds from token sales and handle payment verification.

## Deployment

### Blockchain
- **Platform**: TON blockchain
- **Deployment Tools**: Use TON Labs tools for deploying smart contracts.

### Website
- **Hosting**: Use a reliable web hosting service (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).
- **Domain**: Register a suitable domain name for the website.

## Security Considerations

- **Smart Contract Security**: Conduct thorough testing and audits of the smart contracts.
- **Website Security**: Implement HTTPS, secure payment gateways, and data encryption.
- **Payment Security**: Ensure secure handling of payment information through PayPal and Adyen APIs.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- **Smart Contracts**: Write unit tests for all smart contract functionalities.
- **Website**: Perform unit tests for website functionalities, especially payment processing and form submissions.

### Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test the entire workflow from token purchase to allocation.
- **Payment Testing**: Test payment integrations with sandbox environments of PayPal and Adyen.

### User Testing
- **Beta Testing**: Conduct beta testing with a group of users to gather feedback and identify issues.

## Documentation

- **Technical Documentation**: Document the smart contracts, API integrations, and website architecture.
- **User Guide**: Provide a guide for users on how to purchase tokens and use the website.
- **Developer Guide**: Include setup instructions and code documentation for future developers.
