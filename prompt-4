# DrugNcoin: Tokenomics and Website Development Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive design specifications for the development of "DrugNcoin," a meme-coin utilizing the TON blockchain. It encompasses the tokenomics structure, website functionality, smart contract requirements, payment integration, and referral system necessary for a successful launch and user engagement.

## Tokenomics

### Total Supply
- **Maximum Supply:** 100 billion tokens

### Team Allocation
- **Reserved for Team:** 10 billion tokens (exclusively owned by the team)

## Pre-Sale Rounds

The pre-sale will occur in three distinct rounds with the following price structure:
- **First Round:** $0.0015 per token, ending on August 10, 2024
- **Second Round:** $0.0020 per token, ending on August 30, 2024
- **Third Round:** $0.0030 per token, ending on September 30, 2024

## Website Requirements

### General Specifications
- **Framework:** Vue.js (chosen for its robust integration capabilities with TON wallet/blockchain)
- **Hosting:** AWS Lambda (serverless architecture)

### Functional Pages
1. **Home Page:** Introduction and key information about DrugNcoin.
2. **Tokenomics Page:** Detailed breakdown of token distribution and usage.
3. **Roadmap Page:** Project milestones and future plans.
4. **Pre-Sale Page:** Information and interface for purchasing tokens.
5. **Referral Program Page:** Details and tracking of referral incentives.

### Core Functionalities
- **TON Wallet Integration:** Users must connect their TON wallet to interact with the site and make purchases.
- **Payment Integration:** 
  - **PayPal API:** For standard payments.
  - **Adyen API:** For card and native bank payments.
- **Token Distribution:** Automatic transfer of tokens to user's TON wallet upon successful payment. The amount of tokens is calculated based on the current pre-sale round price.

### Pre-Sale Workflow
1. User connects their TON wallet.
2. User initiates payment via PayPal or Adyen.
3. System verifies payment and calculates the number of tokens based on the pre-sale price.
4. Tokens are transferred to the user's connected TON wallet.

## Smart Contracts

### Token Contract
- Develop a smart contract on the TON blockchain to handle the creation and distribution of DrugNcoin tokens.
- Ensure the contract enforces the maximum supply of 100 billion tokens and the reserved 10 billion tokens for the team.

### Referral System

#### Referral Logic
- Use the TON wallet ID as the unique referral identifier.
- Upon a new TON wallet ID connecting with a referral ID:
  - The referral ID receives tokens based on the following progressive reward table:
    - **1-5 Users:** 5 tokens per referral
    - **6-10 Users:** 7 tokens per referral
    - **11+ Users:** 10 tokens per referral
    - **Every 50 Users:** 100 tokens additional bonus
- Update the referral count each time a new wallet is connected.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Tokenomics and Smart Contracts
1. Design and deploy the token smart contract on the TON blockchain.
2. Ensure secure and verifiable token distribution.

### Phase 2: Website Development
1. Set up the Vue.js framework and integrate TON wallet connectivity.
2. Develop the pre-sale interface with PayPal and Adyen payment systems.
3. Create and deploy the standard informational pages (Home, Tokenomics, Roadmap, Referral Program).

### Phase 3: Testing and Security
1. Conduct thorough testing of the smart contracts and payment integration.
2. Implement security measures to protect user data and transactions.
3. Perform usability testing to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Phase 4: Launch and Monitoring
1. Launch the pre-sale website and initiate marketing campaigns.
2. Monitor the system for performance and security issues.
3. Provide ongoing support and updates based on user feedback and system performance.

## Conclusion

This document serves as the blueprint for developing the DrugNcoin project, ensuring a structured approach to token distribution, website functionality, and user engagement through referral incentives. By adhering to these specifications, the project aims to achieve a successful launch and sustained user growth.
